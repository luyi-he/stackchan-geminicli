"""TTS orchestration: pick an engine, synthesise, encode, and push.

The orchestrator is the glue between the ``say`` MCP tool (defined in
:mod:`stackchan_mcp.stdio_server`) and the engine implementations
registered in :mod:`stackchan_mcp.tts`. It validates arguments, looks
up an engine, runs the synthesis, encodes the result to Opus, and
hands the frames off to :mod:`stackchan_mcp.audio_stream` for delivery.

The framework half (Engine ABC, registry, validation surface) shipped
in PR1 of Issue #70; PR2 wires the actual VOICEVOX → PCM → Opus →
WebSocket pipeline. The signature stays back-compatible with PR1's
tests: ``gateway`` is keyword-only and may be omitted, in which case
calls that pass validation surface a clear error instead of silently
synthesising audio with no destination.

    """Encode and push PCM as it arrives from an async iterator.

    Where :func:`send_pcm_audio` buffers all PCM before encoding,
    ``send_pcm_stream`` accepts an :class:`~collections.abc.AsyncIterator`
    of PCM byte chunks and starts pushing Opus frames to the device as
    soon as enough samples have accumulated for one Opus frame. This
    keeps long utterances (multi-minute TTS, live audio mixes) playing
    on the device with low latency, without holding the entire PCM in
    memory.

    The Opus encoder instance is reused across chunks so the codec's
    internal state (predictors, gain) stays continuous — a fresh encoder
    per chunk would produce audible discontinuities at chunk
    boundaries.

    Args:
        gateway: The :class:`Gateway` instance whose
            :attr:`Gateway.esp32` the audio frames are pushed through.
        pcm_chunks: Async iterator yielding signed-16-bit LE mono PCM
            byte chunks. Chunk sizes need not be aligned to any boundary;
            the function buffers partial frames internally. Empty chunks
            are skipped without error so producers can use them as a
            "still alive" heartbeat. Iteration finishing (with no
            chunks left) flushes any trailing partial frame as
            zero-padded audio and ends the stream cleanly.
        source_rate: Sample rate of incoming PCM. Each chunk is
            resampled to :data:`DEVICE_SAMPLE_RATE` independently via
            linear interpolation; boundary discontinuities are
            negligible for speech-rate inputs.
        source_label: Label used in the orchestrator log so streaming
            producers can be traced separately (e.g.
            ``"voice-tts:msg_abc123"``).

    Returns:
        Dict describing the push: ``source``, ``frame_count``,
        ``sample_rate``, ``frame_duration_ms``, ``duration_ms``. Zero
        frames is a valid (logged-warning) outcome — e.g. the producer
        was cancelled before yielding any audio.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if ``gateway`` is missing, no device is connected,
            the negotiated protocol is not v1, opuslib is unavailable,
            Opus encoding fails, or the device disconnects mid-stream.
